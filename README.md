### Drupal 7 Theme Installation
Follow the Drupal 8 installation instructions, with a few differences (listed below).
- No primary/seconary regions. Instead main menu and secondary menu are provided as variables and just need to be created.
- Install views module
- Install jQuery Update and set it to 1.10


### Node Teaser
- Upload square images, or create a new image style and override the node--teaser.tpl.php template.
